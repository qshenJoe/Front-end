# Object-Oriented Programming
ECMAScript has no concept of classes, and therefore objects are different than in class-based languages.
<br />
<br />
* ECMA-262 defines an object as an "unordered collection of properties each of which contains a primitive value, object, or function."
* Each property or method is identified by a name that is mapped to a value.
* It helps to think of ECMAScript objects as hash tables: nothing more than a grouping of name-value pairs where the value may be data or a function.
* Each Object is created based on a reference type
