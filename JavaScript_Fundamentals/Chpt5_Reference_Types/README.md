# Reference Types
A reference value(object) is an instance of a specific *reference type*. <br />
Rerence types are sometimes called *object definitions*,
because they describe the properties and methods that objects should have.

```javascript
    var person = new Object();
```

This code creates a new instance of the `Object` reference type and stores it in the variable `person`. 
The constructor being used is `Object()`, which creates a simple object with only the default properties and methods.
